# Image Classification Model Using CNN


## Dataset  
**Dogs vs Cats dataset from Kaggle**  
[Dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats)

## Overview

This project implements an **image classification model** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify images of dogs and cats. The iconic "Dogs vs Cats" dataset serves as the benchmark for this binary classification task.

CNNs excel in image classification by automatically learning hierarchical spatial features from raw pixel data, outperforming traditional methods. This repository contains the code to preprocess data, define the CNN architecture, train the model, and analyze results.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`:  
  Handles data loading, preprocessing, training, validation, and testing.

- `model.py`:  
  Defines the CNN architecture and model compilation.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. Dataset: Dogs vs Cats  
- Contains 25,000 labeled images (half dogs, half cats).  
- Images vary in pose, lighting, and background complexity.  
- Filenames include labels (e.g. `cat.0.jpg`, `dog.0.jpg`).

### 2. Data Preprocessing  
- Resize images to a consistent shape (e.g., 150x150 pixels).  
- Extract labels from filenames and convert them to numerical format (0 for cats, 1 for dogs).  
- Scale pixel values to a 0-1 range by dividing by 255.  
- Split dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets for robust evaluation.

### 3. CNN Model Architecture  
The model consists of the following layers:  

- **Convolutional Layers:** Multiple filters to detect edges, textures, and patterns.  
- **Pooling Layers:** Max pooling to reduce spatial dimensions and computation.  
- **Flatten Layer:** Converts 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.  
- **Dense (Fully Connected) Layers:** Learn non-linear feature combinations for classification.  
- **Dropout (optional):** Prevent overfitting by randomly disabling neurons during training.  
- **Output Layer:** Sigmoid activation for binary class probability.

### 4. Training  
- Compile the model with optimizer Adam and binary crossentropy loss.  
- Train over multiple epochs, monitoring accuracy and loss on validation data to prevent overfitting.

### 5. Evaluation  
- Assess performance on the test set by computing accuracy and loss.  
- Visualize training and validation accuracy and loss metrics over epochs to understand learning behavior.
